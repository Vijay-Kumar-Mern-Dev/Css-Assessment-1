<h2 class="txt2">What is CSS ? </h2>

<ol>

    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets .</li>
    <li>Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen ,paper,or in other media .</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through; font-weight: bold;">CSS is not neccesary </span> <span style="background-color: yellow;font-weight: bold;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
    <li style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
</ol>


<h2 class="txt2">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>

<ul>

    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - by using the style element in the head section </li>
    <li>External - by using alink element to link to an external CSS file</li>
    <li>The most common ways to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this <br> <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier <br> for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.

</p>

<p>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.
</p>

<p>
    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are use to target elements to which a style should be applied.
